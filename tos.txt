11:T57e,In order to use the Services, you must be thirteen 13 years of age or older, not be a Prohibited Person, and not have been previously suspended or removed from the Services. A “Prohibited Person” is any person, entity or body that is (a) listed on any U.S., EU (including its Member States) or UK list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals, the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List Entity List, the EU Consolidated List of persons, groups and entities subject to financial sanctions or the UK Consolidated List of Financial Sanctions Targets, (b) located or organized in any U.S. embargoed countries or any country that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country (currently, the Crimea region of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic), or (c) owned or controlled by such persons or entities listed in (a)-(b). By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet the foregoing requirements and will not be using the Services for any illegal activity or to engage in the prohibited activities in Section 5.2. The Company reserves the right to change, modify, or impose additional restrictions with respect to Prohibited Persons at its sole discretion without prior notice.12:T424,The Services may require you to connect your own third-party self-custodial digital wallets (“Wallets”), including in connection with your use of Testnets (as defined below). A self-custodial Wallet means we do not own or control your Wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping your Wallet and any private keys necessary to decrypt your Wallet secure and you should never share your Wallet seed phrase or private keys with anyone else via the Services. We have no ability to help you access or recover your private keys for your Wallet. By using such Wallets to conduct transactions via the Services, you agree that you are governed by the terms of service and privacy policy for the applicable Wallets, and that the Company has no responsibility or liability to you in any way arising from your use of such third-party Wallets, including for any security failures or other errors or failures of such Wallets. We reserve the right to restrict any Wallet addresses from interacting with the Services for any reason, including to ensure legal compliance.13:T411,The Services may include Third-Party software components that are subject to open source and/or pass-through commercial licenses and/or notices (“Third-Party Software” and “Third-Party Software Terms and Notices”, respectively). You acknowledge that your use of the Services may be also governed by such Third-Party Software Terms and Notices, and that to the extent of any conflict between these Terms and any Third-Party Software Terms and Notices, the latter shall control. Any undertakings, representations, warranties, guarantees, conditions, indemnities or other commitments made by the Company in these Terms concerning the Services (if any), are made by the Company and not by any authors, licensors, or suppliers of, or contributors to, such Third-Party Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence or anything in these Terms to the contrary, the Company does not make any representation, warranty, guarantee, or condition, and does not undertake any defense or indemnification, with respect to any Third-Party Software.14:T559,To the extent not prohibited by law, you agree that in no event will the company entities be liable (a) for damages of any kind, including indirect, special, exemplary, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or profits, business interruption or any other damages or losses, arising out of or related to your use or inability to use the services), however caused and under any theory of liability, whether under these terms or otherwise arising in any way in connection with the services or these terms and whether in contract, strict liability or tort (including negligence or otherwise) even if the company entities have been advised of the possibility of such damage, or (b) for any other claim, demand or damages whatsoever resulting from or arising out of or in connection with these terms or the delivery, use or performance of the services. Some jurisdictions (such as the state of New Jersey) do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion or limitation may not apply to you. The company entities’ total liability to you for any damages finally awarded shall not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.15:T4a6,By using the Services, you represent that you have sufficient knowledge and experience in business and financial matters, including a sufficient understanding of blockchain or cryptographic tokens and technologies and other digital assets, storage mechanisms (such as Wallets), blockchain-based software systems, and blockchain technology, to be able to assess and evaluate the risks and benefits of the Services contemplated hereunder, and will bear the risks thereof, including loss of all amounts paid, and the risk that any tokens you receive as a result of your use of the Services may have little or no value. You acknowledge and agree that there are risks associated with interacting with cryptographic tokens and using blockchain technology. These include, but are not limited to, risk of losing access to cryptocurrency due to loss of private key(s), custodial error or purchaser error, risk of mining or blockchain attacks, risk of hacking and security weaknesses, risk of unfavorable regulatory intervention in one or more jurisdictions, risk related to token taxation, risk of personal information disclosure, risk of uninsured losses, volatility risks, and unanticipated risks.16:T467,By entering into these Terms and accessing or using the Services, you agree that you shall defend, indemnify and hold the Company Entities harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by the Company Entities arising out of or in connection with: (a) your violation or breach of any term of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation, including any such violation or breach related to any rewards that may be available as a result of your participation in a program maintained by us or our affiliates; (b) your violation of any rights of any Third-Party; (c) your misuse of the Services; (d) your negligence or wilful misconduct. If you are obligated to indemnify any Company Entity hereunder, then you agree that Company (or, at its discretion, the applicable Company Entity) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether Company wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms, and you agree to fully cooperate with Company in the defense or settlement of such claim.17:T4c8,After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to the Company’s services and/or products, including the Services, and any use or access or lack of access thereto, will be resolved by arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the Claim. You and the Company agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered in accordance with the Liechtenstein Arbitration Rules (LIS) of the Liechtenstein Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The seat of the arbitral tribunal will be Vaduz, Liechtenstein and the arbitral proceeding will be conducted in English. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the laws of the Principality of Liechtenstein. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you and the Company are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.18:T471,To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and the company each agree that any proceeding to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy will be brought and conducted only in the respective party’s individual capacity and not as part of any class (or purported class), consolidated, multiple-plaintiff, or representative action or proceeding (“class action”). You and the company agree to waive the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any class action. You and the company expressly waive any ability to maintain a class action in any forum. If the dispute is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have the authority to combine or aggregate claims, conduct a class action, or make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Further, you and the company agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings for more than one person’s claims, and it may not otherwise preside over any form of a class action. For the avoidance of doubt, however, you can seek public injunctive relief to the extent authorized by law and consistent with the exceptions clause above.19:T440,You agree that you will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Services and/or other information or materials provided by the Company hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export without first obtaining such license or approval. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or any country that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, or (b) to anyone listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You are responsible for and hereby agree to comply at your sole expense with all applicable United States export laws and regulations.1a:T4c2,If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms and the licenses granted hereunder may be assigned by the Company but may not be assigned by you without the prior express written consent of the Company. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect. The Services are operated by us in Liechtenstein. Those who choose to access the Services from locations outside Liechtenstein do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. These Terms are governed by the laws of the Principality of Liechtenstein District Court and any appellate court from any such court, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the arbitration venue set forth in Section 9, or if arbitration does not apply, then the aforementioned Liechtenstein courts.2:[["$","section",null,{"className":"bg-white-weak relative border-b border-black lg:min-h-[550px]","children":["$","div",null,{"id":"$undefined","className":"w-full max-w-[1265px] mx-auto px-4 md:px-10 relative z-10","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"pt-36 pb-16 lg:pt-56 lg:pb-20 lg:flex","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"lg:w-7/12","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"w-full","children":["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-pretty font-youth text-[2.3125rem] leading-[1.2] lg:text-6xl leading-[1.066666666666667] mb-10","children":"Terms of Service"}]}]}],"$undefined"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"lg:w-5/12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-youth text-[1.75rem] leading-[1.2] lg:text-[2rem] lg:leading-tight mb-2 lg:mb-6","children":"Last Revised on January 16, 2023"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-pretty text-[1.0625rem] leading-[1.647] undefined","children":"Welcome to the Terms of Service (these “Terms”) for the Celestia website and documentation accessible at https://celestia.org/ (the “Website”) as operated on behalf of Strange Loop Labs AG (“Company”, “we”, or “us”).
