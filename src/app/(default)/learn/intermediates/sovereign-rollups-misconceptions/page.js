						Sovereign rollups combine features from multiple different blockchain designs. The unique design can create misconceptions
						about sovereign rollups, such as how they work, what security they have, or what kinds of features are possible.
					</Body>
					<Body>We’re going to explore and answer some of those misconceptions.</Body>

				<Section id={"sovereign-rollups-dont-inherit-security-of-the-DA-layer"}>
					<Heading tag={"h2"}>Sovereign rollups don’t inherit security of the DA layer</Heading>
					<Body>Security covers multiple aspects. Sovereign rollups do inherit multiple aspects of security from the DA layer.</Body>
					<Heading tag={"h3"} size={"sm"}>
						Data availability
					</Heading>
					<Body>
						The most obvious security feature that sovereign rollups inherit from DA layers is{" "}
						<Link href={"/glossary/data-availability/"}>data availability</Link>. The two key properties that data availability provides
						are:
					</Body>
					<ListItem>
						<Link href={"/glossary/liveness/"}>Liveness</Link>: The blockchain is making progress.
					</ListItem>
					<ListItem>
						<Link href={"/glossary/safety/"}>Safety</Link>: Invalid transactions get rejected.
					</ListItem>
					<Body>
						ZK sovereign rollups use <Link href={"/glossary/validity-proof/"}>validity proofs</Link> to prove that all their transactions
						are correct - this covers the safety aspect. What data availability guarantees in this case is liveness. Without data
						availability, a ZK sovereign rollup can’t finalize new blocks, causing the chain to halt. Transactions can continue to
						successfully finalize in blocks so long as the sovereign rollup nodes can read and write data to the DA layer.
					</Body>
					<Body>
						For an optimistic sovereign rollup, <Link href={"/glossary/state-transition-fraud-proof/"}>fraud proofs</Link> are used to
						prove if any transactions are invalid. All transaction data for a block is necessary for fraud proofs to work. That means
						without data availability, invalid transactions can’t get rejected. Therefore, optimistic sovereign rollups inherit security
						for liveness and safety guarantees from the DA layer.
					</Body>
					<Heading tag={"h3"} size={"sm"}>
						Re-org resistance & consensus
					</Heading>
					<Body>
						Another element of security that sovereign rollups inherit is re-org resistance. A re-org attack occurs when a fork changes
						the blockchain’s history. The history change may remove transactions that were finalized or transactions that were in the
						process of finalizing.
					</Body>
					<Image src={"/images/app/learn/Intermediates/sovereign-rollups-misconceptions/misconceptions_1.jpg"} alt={""} />
					<Body>
						Sovereign rollups are protected against re-org attacks because their transactions receive consensus from the DA layer. The DA
						layer provides consensus to sovereign rollup transactions by ordering and finalizing them on the DA layer.
					</Body>
					<Body>
						Once sovereign rollup transactions get finalized on the DA layer, they will stay finalized as long as the DA layer doesn’t
						experience a re-org. Therefore, sovereign rollups inherit resistance from re-org attacks and consensus from the DA layer.
					</Body>
					<Heading tag={"h3"} size={"sm"}>
						Censorship resistance
					</Heading>
					<Body>
						Optionally, sovereign rollups can also inherit censorship resistance from the DA layer. Censorship resistance is a property
						that sovereign rollups may want to inherit from the DA layer because it can help protect users against malicious or
						centralized sequencers from censoring their transactions.
					</Body>
					<Body>There’s two main ways censorship resistance can come from the DA layer:</Body>
					<ListItem>
						No sequencers: Users have their transactions sent directly to the DA layer. The DA layer is responsible for including
						finalizing each individual transaction. Now, the sovereign rollup inherits censorship resistance from the DA layer.
					</ListItem>
					<ListItem>
						Sequencers: User transactions are published in a block to the DA layer. If the sequencer tries to censor a user, they can send
						a special inbox transaction directly to the DA layer. The inbox transaction would let users get their transactions included in
						the rollup chain even if a sequencer was censoring.
					</ListItem>
				</Section>
				<Section id={"Sovereign-rollups-lack-bridging-options"}>
					<Heading tag={"h2"}>Sovereign rollups lack bridging options</Heading>
					<Body>
						The native bridges of smart contract rollups have <Link href={"/glossary/trust-minimized-bridge/"}>trust-minimized</Link>{" "}
						security because the settlement layer verifies the rollup’s entire block. Sovereign rollups can’t bridge to the DA layer if it
						doesn’t verify its transactions, right?
					</Body>
					<Body>
						Sovereign rollups can have a bridge with their DA layer. If the DA layer supports smart contracts, the bridge can be
						trust-minimized, although the bridge may require governance for the rollup to preserve sovereignty. If there is no smart
						contract support, like with Celestia, then the bridge would require stronger trust assumptions.
					</Body>
					<Body>
						Importantly, sovereign rollups can have bridges between each other. These bridges can be trust-minimized if both sovereign
						rollups use the same DA layer and have fraud or validity proofs. This is possible through light clients that verify proofs of
						bridged transactions.
					</Body>
					<Image src={"/images/app/learn/Intermediates/sovereign-rollups-misconceptions/misconceptions_2.jpg"} alt={""} />
					<Body>
						The design space is broad, with{" "}
						<Link href={"https://blog.celestia.org/sovereign-rollup-chains/"}>many possible solutions</Link> for secure bridging between
						sovereign rollups.
					</Body>
				</Section>
				<Section id={"sovereign-rollups-need-a-settlement-layer"}>
					<Heading tag={"h2"}>Sovereign rollups need a settlement layer</Heading>
					<Body>Smart contract rollups on Ethereum need a settlement layer. Isn’t that also true for sovereign rollups?</Body>
					<Body>
						Sovereign rollups do not need a settlement layer because they{" "}
						<Link href={"/learn/intermediates/settlement-in-the-modular-stack#settlement-layers"}>transaction verification</Link>.
						Sovereign rollups don’t use the DA layer to verify their transactions. Verification is done by the sovereign rollup nodes
						instead.
					</Body>
					<Image src={"/images/app/learn/Intermediates/sovereign-rollups-misconceptions/misconceptions_3.jpg"} alt={""} />
					<Body>
						This means sovereign rollups can use a blockchain as a DA layer even if it doesn&apos;t support smart contracts like Celestia.
					</Body>
					<Body>
						Now, imagine a developer who wants to build a smart contract rollup on a DA layer that doesn&apos;t support smart contracts.
						They can deploy their smart contract rollup on an existing sovereign rollup. The sovereign rollup acts as the{" "}
						<Link href={"/learn/intermediates/settlement-in-the-modular-stack#settlement-in-the-modular-stack"}>settlement layer</Link>,
						with a native bridge connection and proof verification.
					</Body>
					<Image src={"/images/app/learn/Intermediates/sovereign-rollups-misconceptions/misconceptions_4.jpg"} alt={""} />
					<Body>
						These possibilities allow DA layers, even minimal ones like Celestia, to support a wide variation of rollups and other
						blockchain designs.
