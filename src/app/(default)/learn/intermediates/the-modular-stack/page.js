					<Heading tag={"h2"}>Introduction</Heading>
					<Body>
						A new paradigm is emerging in which modular blockchains are enabling new chains to be constructed in ways that were not
						previously possible. Because of this, the design possibilities are vast for both the individual blockchain and the modular
						stack it is a part of. Different types of modular blockchains can work in a collaborative manner, varying by purpose and
						architecture.
					</Body>
				</Section>
				<Section id={"the-modular-blockchain-stack"}>
					<Heading tag={"h2"}>The Modular Blockchain Stack</Heading>
					<Body>
						The four functions that modular blockchains can consist of are execution, settlement, consensus, and data availability.
					</Body>
					<ListItem>Execution: The environment where applications live and state changes are executed.</ListItem>
					<ListItem>
						Settlement: An optional hub for execution layers to verify proofs, resolve fraud disputes, and bridge between other execution
						layers.
					</ListItem>
					<ListItem>Consensus: Agreement on the order of transactions.</ListItem>
					<ListItem>Data availability: Verification that transaction data is available to download.</ListItem>
					<Body>
						It is typical for layers within a modular stack to provide more than one function, as in many cases it is impractical to have
						one without another. For example, a modular blockchain that specializes in data availability also requires consensus to order
						the data, otherwise the history of the data can’t be determined.
					</Body>
				</Section>
				<Section id={"layer-1-and-2"}>
					<Heading tag={"h2"}>Layer 1 and 2</Heading>
					<Body>
						Naive modular stacks were initially constructed to provide scalability to a monolithic layer 1. In this stack, layer 1
						provides all key functions—including execution—while layer 2 specializes only in execution.
					</Body>
					<Image src={"/images/app/learn/Intermediates/the-modular-stack/execution_layer+monolithic.jpg"} alt={""} />
					<Body>
						The most prominent type of layer 2 is a rollup, which provides an environment for applications to be deployed to, and for
						transactions to be processed that interact with those applications. Layer 1 supports the rollup by allowing it to publish its
						blocks, which at minimum ensures that the transaction data in the block is ordered and available. Since layer 1 also has
						execution capabilities, it can ensure the validity of transactions if the layer 2 requires. Additionally, the layer 1 can also
						act as a hub to connect layer 2s, allowing them to bridge tokens and liquidity between them.
					</Body>
					<Body>
						Essentially, the layer 1 is a monolithic chain that receives additional scale from layer 2. In most cases, the capacity of
						layer 2 is also dependent on layer 1s capacity. As a result, this implementation of a layer 1 & layer 2 stack is suboptimal
						for scalability.
					</Body>

				<Section id={"execution-settlement-and-data-availability"}>
					<Heading tag={"h2"}>Execution, settlement, and data availability</Heading>
					<Body>
						To optimize more of the benefits that a modular blockchain stack can provide, the functions can be decoupled across
						specialized modular blockchains.
					</Body>
					<Image src={"/images/app/learn/Intermediates/the-modular-stack/3_layer_stack.jpg"} alt={""} />
					<Body>
						The execution layer sits at the top of the stack and plays the same role as layer 2 in the previous stack. Modular stacks
						beyond layer 1 and 2 are more flexible in their construction, requiring more specific naming that is coherent with the
						functionality that each layer provides.
					</Body>
					<Body>
						The settlement layer is unique to that of regular layer 1s that provide settlement because it decouples the settlement
						functionality from the rest of the functions. The result is an execution chain that can be used specifically for settlement,
						enabling a <Link href={"/glossary/trust-minimized-bridge"}>trust-minimized bridge</Link> between the execution and settlement
						layer and providing a way by which execution layers can bridge between each other.
					</Body>
					<Body>
						The execution layer may choose to publish its full blocks to the settlement layer, after which the settlement layer will build
						its own blocks that include transactions from the execution layer and publish the transaction data to the consensus and data
						availability layer. This is only one of multiple ways that the settlement layer could function within the modular stack.
					</Body>
					<Body>
						At the bottom of this construction is the consensus and data availability layer. As the name suggests, it only provides
						consensus over the order of transactions and verifies that their data is available. Because there is no execution
						functionality, only transaction data is published by the settlement layer rather than the contents of the entire block.
					</Body>
				</Section>
				<Section id={"execution-and-data-availability"}>
					<Heading tag={"h2"}>Execution and data availability</Heading>
					<Body>
						In the previous two modular stacks, the execution layer solely focused on execution and off-loaded the remaining functions to
						other layers. However, because modular blockchains are flexible in the purposes they can provide, an execution layer isn’t
						only limited to only posting its blocks to a settlement layer. For example, a modular stack can be created that involves no
						settlement layer, only an execution layer on top of a consensus and data availability layer.
					</Body>
					<Image src={"/images/app/learn/Intermediates/the-modular-stack/execution+consensus_layer.jpg"} alt={""} />
					<Body>
						Under this modular stack, the execution layer would be sovereign such that it has the ability to{" "}
						<Link href={"/glossary/fork"}>fork</Link>, and for its nodes to determine which execution rules are canonical. If the
						execution layer is a rollup and requires <Link href={"/glossary/state-transition-fraud-proof"}>fraud proofs</Link> or{" "}
						<Link href={"/glossary/validity-proof"}>validity proofs</Link> to be verified, they can be distributed through the
						rollup&apos;s peer-to-peer layer rather than published to a settlement layer. Validity proofs would be distributed with each
						block, and fraud proofs only during <Link href={"/glossary/dispute-resolution"}>disputes</Link>.
