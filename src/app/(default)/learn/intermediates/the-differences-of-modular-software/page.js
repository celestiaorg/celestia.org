						Modularity is an essential concept in the design and development of blockchains. It enables developers to focus on customizing
						the parts of the blockchain they care about most. Many blockchains exist that use modular software to improve their
						development process. However, a blockchain built using modular software should not be confused with a modular blockchain.
						Let’s look at some of the differences between modular blockchains and modular software.
					</Body>

				<Section id={"the-differences"}>
					<Heading tag={"h2"}>The differences</Heading>
					<Body>
						Modular software and modular blockchains share the same idea: a blockchain&apos;s core functions can be distinct components.
						But the two go about it in different ways.
					</Body>
					<ListItem>
						Modular blockchain: A blockchain that specializes in one or two core functions. Modular blockchains with different specialties
						combine together to fulfill all the core functions needed.
					</ListItem>
					<ListItem>
						Modular software: Software for building blockchains that separates the core functions among different pieces of software.
					</ListItem>
					<Image src={"/images/app/learn/Intermediates/the-differences-of-modular-software/Celestia_cosmos_celestia.jpg"} alt={""} />
					<Body>
						The key difference between the two is that modular software is the code that is used to build the blockchain, while a modular
						blockchain is a live blockchain network.
					</Body>
					<Body>
						An example of a modular blockchain is a rollup because it specializes in a single function - execution. A rollup processes
						transactions and sends them to another modular blockchain to handle the other core functions - consensus and data
						availability.
					</Body>
					<Image src={"/images/app/learn/Intermediates/the-differences-of-modular-software/Celestia_modular_blockchain.jpg"} alt={""} />
					<Body>
						On the other hand, an example of modular software is Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK. Tendermint is the consensus software that
						validators run to produce new blocks. The Cosmos SDK is the execution environment that processes transactions. Together,
						Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK serve as a toolkit for building blockchains.
					</Body>
					<Image src={"/images/app/learn/Intermediates/the-differences-of-modular-software/Celestia_monolithic_blockchain.jpg"} alt={""} />
					<Body>
						Since the software is modular, it is easier to change or swap out specific parts of the blockchain. For example, a developer
						can build a blockchain that uses Tendermint for consensus and use a different execution environment, like the EVM.
					</Body>

						Monolithic blockchains
					</Heading>
					<Body>
						The most common use case so far for modular software is for building monolithic blockchains. Instead of building a new
						blockchain from scratch when a team wants to make improvements, modular software enables them to use an existing framework to
						build off of. This allows developers to focus on improving specific parts of the blockchain they want to, without worrying
						about building all the blockchain’s features.
					</Body>
					<Body>
						Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK have since become the most used modular software for building monolithic blockchains, with over{" "}
						<Link href={"https://mapofzones.com/home?columnKey=dau&period=30d"}>45 public chains</Link> running today. Some of those
						include monolithic blockchains like the Cosmos Hub and even modular blockchains like rollups.
					</Body>
					<Heading size={"sm"} tag={"h3"}>
						Rollups
					</Heading>
					<Body>
						We know that modular software is useful for building monolithic blockchains, but it can also be useful for building modular
						blockchains like rollups. For example, you can take the Cosmos SDK and replace Tendermint with some rollup software, so now
						you get a Cosmos SDK rollup. This rollup software is exactly how Rollkit works.
					</Body>
					<Body>
						Rollkit enables developers to build rollups using the principles of modular software and modular blockchains. Components of
						Rollkit’s software can be easily modified or replaced, like the execution environment, so developers can run any number of
						compatible VMs, such as the Cosmos SDK or the EVM. This culminates in a flexible framework for developers that enables them to
						easily deploy new modular blockchains with minimal overhead.
