            Most blockchains today are monolithic, so it only makes sense to
            understand what they are before we explain what modular means.
          </Body>
          <Body>
            A monolithic chain is a generalist blockchain that performs all
            tasks. Really, the monolithic approach is “do everything yourself”.

            Some blockchains that fall into this monolithic category include
            Solana and Sui.

          <Body>
            We can’t forget that monolithic chains were a big first step. They
            showed us that you could build all sorts of new applications using
            blockchains. Once people started building and using apps on them,
            they ran into some difficulties.
          </Body>
          <ListItem>
            You can’t build anything you like. Sharing space on someone else’s
            blockchain limits what you can build for your app.
          </ListItem>

            Expensive apps. High fees can creep up, making apps unaffordable.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Access isn’t open to all. Raising capacity usually means fewer
            people can afford to check that the network is running correctly.
          </ListItem>
          <Body>
            Many of these difficulties make monolithic blockchains difficult to
            use or miss the reasons why we use blockchains in the first place.

            In the last few years, a new approach to building blockchains
            emerged. That new approach is what people are calling “modular
            blockchains”. But what are they exactly?
          </Body>
          <Body>
            Well, modular blockchains are specialists. They perform only one or
            two tasks - the opposite of monolithic chains.
          </Body>
          <Image

          <Body>
            Modular chains don’t sit alone, though. Multiple of them combine to
            perform all the tasks a monolithic chain does by itself. This
            combination of chains is what we call a modular stack.

            There might be some unfamiliar terms in the image above, like data
            availability or execution. Don’t worry. We’ll go over those in later
            articles.

          <Body>
            You can think about modular blockchains like Lego pieces. You can
            mix and match Legos to create different structures, just like you
            can mix and match modular blockchains to create different modular
            stacks.
          </Body>
          <Body>
            In the modular category we have blockchains like Celestia and 
            <Link href={"/glossary/rollup"}>rollups</Link>. Rollups host
            applications and do many of the same things that monolithic
            blockchains do. What makes a rollup modular is that it uses another
            blockchain, like Celestia, to complete the tasks it doesn’t do.

            As you can tell, modular chains specialize and work together to do
            all the tasks a single monolithic chain does. If there’s one thing
            you should take away about modular and monolithic chains, it’s that:

            Celestia is really simple for a reason. Without execution, Celestia
            has way fewer restrictions on how applications and modular
            blockchains can be built on it. The wide design space includes
            everything from new virtual machines to unique privacy models and
            new types of blockchain architectures. That only scratches the
            surface.

            is the technology that Celestia uses to make this happen. The name
            might sound confusing. But, all it means is that Celestia can
            provide more capacity for applications as more users join the
            network.

            But, if people can’t afford to check the chain, then it’s not that
            much different than using a centralized application. That’s why
            it&apos;s essential to keep it inexpensive for people to confirm the

            used by modular blockchains to make this possible. As you journey
            down the modular rabbit hole, you’ll see these terms come up quite a
            bit. All you need to know for now is that they can help make
            blockchains really inexpensive for people to check they’re running

            And that’s the simplified version of modular and monolithic
            blockchains. Monolithic blockchains came first to show us what was
            possible with decentralized applications. And now we have modular
            blockchains to take the ideas further, while sticking to the values
            we love about blockchains.
